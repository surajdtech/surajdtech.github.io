Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Suraj**. I specialize in:


- **AWS** (Kinesis, MSK, Firehose, Lambda, EKS)
- **Databricks** (UC, Delta Lake, Auto Loader, performance tuning)
- **Neo4j** (Flink + Kinesis/MSK streaming POCs)
- **SQL Server** (heavy stored procedure tuning, JMeter load tests)
- **Agentic AI** (MCP servers, function-calling agents, semantic tooling)


This site captures real-world playbooks Iâ€™ve used across projects. If a post saves you time, Iâ€™ve done my job.
