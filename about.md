Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **Suraj Dighe** â€” a Data Platform Architect focused on **realâ€‘time pipelines, Spark/Databricks performance, and graphâ€‘powered use cases**. I like turning ambiguous problems into **observable, costâ€‘efficient data products**.

### What Iâ€™m great at
- **Realâ€‘time streaming on AWS:** Kinesis/MSK, Lambda, Firehose â†’ S3/Databricks.  
- **Gateway design:** FastAPI on EKS with configâ€‘driven routing and latency headers.  
- **Spark & Databricks tuning:** adaptive partitioning, AQE, caching, autoscaling.  
- **Graph + streaming:** Flink/Kafka â†’ Neo4j for journeys, anomaly detection, personalization.  
- **Orchestration & DevOps:** Step Functions, EventBridge, Airflow, Terraform, fineâ€‘grained IAM.

### Recent impact
- Built a **dualâ€‘path event capture service** (Kinesis for small payloads, MSK for large) fronted by **FastAPI on EKS**.  
- Led Spark/DBR **cost and latency** optimizations (AQE, partitioning, memory tuning).  
- Delivered **realâ€‘time graph updates** using **Flink + Neo4j**.  
- Standardized pipeline templates and CI/CD practices to speed up onboarding and reliability.

If a post or project here saves you time on a real incident or migration, Iâ€™ve done my job.
